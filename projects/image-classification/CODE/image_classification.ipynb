You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded.  You'll get to apply what you learned and build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.  At the end, you'll get to see your neural network's predictions on the sample images.\n",
